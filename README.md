# Arduino scripts

This repository contains a wide range of scripts written for work with Arduino. 

## Steps to get started with Arduino
1. [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Connect the Arduino board to your pc using USB B cable
3. Configure the IDE <br>
Navigate to Tools > Board > Arduino Uno. However, if you are using a different board (i.e., not the Arduino Uno), you must select the proper board!
Next, you must tell the IDE which port the Arduino is on. To do this, navigate to Tools > Port > and then select the port on which Arduino is present.

#### And you are ready to go 😁
